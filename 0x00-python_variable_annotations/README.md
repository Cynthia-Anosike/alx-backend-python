## Variable Annotations

Type Annotations: helps in code documentation, allows developers to know the type of a variable. it also helps in linting and validation.

# This is how you declare the type of a variable
age: int = 1

# You don't need to initialize a variable to annotate it
a: int  # Ok (no value at runtime until assigned)

# Doing so can be useful in conditional branches
child: bool
if age < 18:
    child = True
else:
    child = False
